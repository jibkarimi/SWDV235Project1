            Make every day casual Friday, because it’s always business “casual” in the Suitsy.
            Plus, having to unzip the thing all the way down, from the neck to the crotch,
            in order to use a urinal will probably make you the most popular guy in the bathroom
            (which is always a good thing).
            With only a month left to vote on whether this Peter Pan-goes-to-the-office idea becomes a
            reality in the Betabrand shop, it’s pretty much your duty to go and vote. Especially since
            not everyone appreciates the concept, with some “fashion aficionados” taking serious issue.
            GQ (more like pee-yew), said of it, “we challenge you to imagine yourself not being lazy and
            buying a proper tailored suit instead,” as if it is somehow slackerish to create a multipurpose
            fashion item that you can sleep, work, and jump out of an airplane in. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

            Yes, it’s an interconnected jacket, dress shirt, and pants that supposedly make you feel like you’re
            wearing pajamas, with nobody else the wiser. By combining the elements of fashion forward business

            tearing the crotch of your pants. Or perhaps you’re not sure if the one night stand you brought home is
            ready
            to get down. Slip into something more comfortable without running the risk of scaring away a nice person

            San Francisco is a pretty casual city, but there’s still nothing like a dude in a suit,
            especially when that suit is custom-made, and he designed it himself. Klein Epstein & Parker
            is a crazy-classy shop that opened up recently in Hayes Valley. They’re all about changing the
            perception of what it means to shop for a suit. Instead of having to pick the least-worst fitting
            suit from existing options, men and women can get in on the experience by designing their own
            clothes and having them tailor-made to the measurements of their body. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
