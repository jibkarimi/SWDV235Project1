            <h1 class="welcome">Welcome to Men Suit</h1>
            <p>The making process of the suit consist in three stages: design and cuts, confection and repairs (final adjustments). It depends on the kind and quality of the fabric that the team in the tailor shop will invest between 80-90 hours of work, since the moment of taking the measurements until the client receives his suit. However, the finest fabrics (from super 180’s to super 250´s), require more time because is necessary to treat them in a very delicate way, in that case, the process last until 110 hours. For example, with the vicuña (one of the finest fabrics), the time can extend five more days and that is because the vicuña is so delicate that in the moment that it is ironed, it crumples.</p>

            <p> In the first stage, the customer's measurements will be taken. At this point it is very important for the tailor to talk with him, not only to find out what he would like to get from a tailored suit, but also to have an opportunity to observe his body structure, mainly the shape of his shoulders and back and symmetry of your body (if the shoulders are high, low or normal and the type of back: loaded, erect or gibbous), in fact, the observation of these is fundamental since these measures are the basis for the bag design. He also uses it to analyze if the clothes he wears fit him.</p>

            <p> After that, the tailor shows him the fabrics sample book, and he asks him for what occasion is that the client wants the suit (daily use, black tie event, a morning event, etc.), that information will help to the tailor to recommend the perfect fabric. Once that the client chooses the fabric and the colours, the tailor designs the suit and cuts the suit patterns for elaborate it.</p>

            <p> The suit patterns (on manila paper) are handmade and they will be used for make the baste and the fitting. It is necessary to pay attention to the measurements of the chest, waist and arms. The baste is handmade, in that way if there are any changes, those are easier to do. In the meantime, the tailor is ordering the fabrics to England, accord with the client´s selection. When the fabrics arrive, in the tailor shop, they already have the suit patterns and they proceed to the second stage.</p>

            <p>In this part, the bundle is made, that includes the canvas and trimming that were selected for the suit. Now, the shirt, the jacket and trousers are being manufactured. Every garment is composed for different materials and fabrics that will give the elegance and quality that distinguish them. In the case of the jacket, the lining is made of bemberg (a fabric made of fine cotton fibres); for the other parts are used muslin, jute and cotton felt. The buttons can be of mother of pearl or buffalo horns. (At the end of this article, there is a list of the materials)</p>

            <p>Now, the second stage is over and the fitting process starts, that is when the client comes to the tailor shop and he tries the baste on for the final fittings. In spite of the patterns and the fittings are handmade basted, the final part of the suit is made in a sewing machine. In this part of the process, the tailoring specialists will help to the master tailor with the elaboration of the trousers, the jacket and the vest. (We invite you to read here the article about the daily work in the tailoring workshop)</p>

            <p>The last stage is Final adjustments, that is when the client puts the last fitting on and the tailor´s team do the last modifications before to deliver to the client. </p>
